# against-censorship

Inicialy, sorry for weak english. I am learning it.
The code is a little jumbled, because i am learning programation too.

This project is an ideia for discuss anything.
Every is based in posts (i agree) and (i disagree) and your responses.
It's possible send some imagens, videos and short text for defend an ideia.

In times of fakenews, discuss is necessary to all.
Each post can be response with new post (i agree) or (i disagree). These can be answered with new postings, and so on.

The center of mecanism is an ideia and yours answers. Not the person who answered. The important thing is the argumentation and not who made it.

Other center point is the impossibility of a person contact other people, as a profile or direct message. 

It doesn't matter who spoke, what spoke or why they spoke. Each has its reasons and here everyone is absolutely free.

That's why democracy is so beautiful

The ideia don't are create a new social network, because I don't want people to follow people and lead their way of thinking and acting.
I want to get people to reflect and analyze things by weighing their positive and negative points and freely creating their opinion.

So people are free to express their opinions, and your posts will be more relevant as the community agrees.
It also serves as a learning experience for anything, as we will have arguments for and against.

That is what I now miss. Only one point of view is spread by the press and social media is censoring those who do not strictly follow their political dictatorships.

The content in majority is in portugues for now.

When i have learned the good patner for development and estruturation, i going update this repository.

I need help for build this.

If possible, contact me in portuguese or espanish because my understanding will be better. But if that is not possible, it can be in English.

Thanks
